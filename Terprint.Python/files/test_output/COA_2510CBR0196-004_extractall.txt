Definitions and Abbreviations used in this report: Total THC = Delta 9 THC + (THCA*0.877), Total CBD = CBD + (CBDA*0.877), Total Cannabinoids = THC + THCA + CBD + CBDA + CBG + CBGA + Delta 8 THC + THCV + CBDV + CBC + CBN, Total THC and Total CBD are
expressed as mg in total package weight, (Dilution) = Dilution Factor, (%) = Percent, (mg/g) = Milligrams per Gram, (mg/mL) = Milligrams per Milliliter, (mg/kg) = Milligrams per Kilogram, (ug/kg) = Microgram per Kilogram, (cfu/g) = Colony Forming Unit per Gram,
Action Limit of Absent is equivalent to < 1 cfu/g, (aw) = Water Activity, (LOD) = Limit of Detection, (LOQ) = Limit of Quantitation; (ppm) = parts per million; (ppb) = parts per billion; Units for ppm also expressed as (mg/kg); Units for ppb also expressed as (ug/kg).All
measurements and calibrations at Method Testing Labs are traceable to the International System of Units (SI) through an unbroken chain of comparisons and from recognized national metrology institutes. Compounded measurement uncertainty for any analyte is
available upon request.
