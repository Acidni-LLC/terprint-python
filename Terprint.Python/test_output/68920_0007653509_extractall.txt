Definitions and Abbreviations used in this report: Total Active CBD = CBD + (CBD-A * 0.877), *Total CBDV = CBDV + (CBDVA * 0.867), Total Active THC = THCA-A * 0.877 + Delta 9
THC, Total THCV = THCV + (THCVA * 0.87) , CBG Total = (CBGA * 0.878) + CBG, CBN Total = (CBNA * 0.876) + CBN, Total CBC = CBC + (CBCA * 0.877), Total THC-O-Acetate = Delta 8
THC-O-Acetate + Delta 9 THC-O-Acetate, Total THCP = Delta8-THCP + Delta9-THCP, Total Cannabinoids = Total percentage of cannabinoids within the sample. (mg/ml) = Milligrams
per Milliliter, LOQ = Limit of Quantitation, LOD = Limit of Detection, Dilution = Dilution Factor, (ppb) = Parts per Billion, (%) = Percent, (cfu/g) = Colony Forming Unit per Gram, (µg/g) =
Microgram per Gram, (ppm) = Parts per Million, (ppm) = (µg/g), (aw) = Water Activity, (mg/Kg) = Milligram per Kilogram. ACS uses simple acceptance criteria. Passed –
Analyte/microbe is not detected or is at the level below the action limit per FL rule 64ER20-39, 5K-4.036, 5K-4.034. Failed – Analyte/microbe is at the level that equal or above the
action limit per FL rule 64ER20-39, 5K-4.036, 5K-4.034
Total Contaminant Load (TCL) - The sum of all Heavy Metals and Agricultural Agents present above the LOQ, but below the Acceptable Limit.
