expressed as mg in total package weight, (Dilution) = Dilution Factor, (%) = Percent, (mg/g) = Milligrams per Gram, (mg/mL) = Milligrams per Milliliter, (mg/kg) = Milligrams per Kilogram, (ug/kg) = Microgram per Kilogram, (cfu/g) = Colony Forming Unit per Gram,
Action Limit of Absent is equivalent to < 1 cfu/g, (aw) = Water Activity, (LOD) = Limit of Detection, (LOQ) = Limit of Quantitation; (ppm) = parts per million; (ppb) = parts per billion; Units for ppm also expressed as (mg/kg); Units for ppb also expressed as (ug/kg).All
